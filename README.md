# Custom Terminal Website (armanterminal.com)🌐💻

Welcome to my **Custom Terminal Website**! This project is my unique take on a personal portfolio, designed to resemble the aesthetics and functionality of a terminal (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any Linux terminal). It's built entirely from scratch using **Rust**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**.

## 🌟 Features
- **Dynamic Showcase**: A platform to display my skills in Software Development and Computer Science.
- **Scalable Design**: Continuously updated with new projects, optimizations, and aesthetic improvements.
- **Terminal Aesthetic**: Complete with custom **ASCII art**, **terminal-like commands**, and a sleek, dark-themed interface.
- **Interactive Commands**: Type commands directly into the terminal, including `clear` to reset the interface.
